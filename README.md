# HEY! I'm Mike Masters
I am a career educator who has worked in **two of the largest public school districts** as well as two higher education institutions. 

## Current Work Experience
I work at [Amundsen High School](https://www.amundsenhs.org/) on the Northside of Chicago where I coach Boys Golf and Girls Badminton. Recently, I changed positions to start teaching Computer Science. I am excited to use my professional experience and skills in this role. 

## First Tech Memory
One of my first tech memories is waking up on Christmas morning to a new SEGA Genesis console with Troy Aikman football.

As a avid sports fan, this first video game began my love for technology and the ways that you can connection with your passions and with other people in new and exciting ways. 

## Brief Bio
I grew in the small town of Carl Junction, Missouri with only four thousand people in my town. It wasn't until in college when I had the opportunity to experience the energy and life of the big city and I have not looked back. Since I did not orginally go to college for educaiton, I participated in a program called New York City Teaching Fellows where I was able to get my Masters in Education from St. John's University. I lived in work in Washington Heights, Manhattan for 5 years while working in New York City Public Schools, the largest school district in the nation.
